## Content of Repo

ðŸ“‚ app/  
Contains the webapplication created with streamlit as well as a custom Dockerfile and the final model.

ðŸ“‚ data/  
Contains some of the metadata provided by FMA. Also some sample audiofiles for testing and the vectors predicted by our model.

ðŸ“‚ docs/  
Contains the final documentation, demo video and presentations of the project.

ðŸ“‚ src/  
Contains almost all notebooks created during the project. For example the classifiers, model evaluation and utilities like feature extraction and redis database queries.

## Running the Project with Docker (used for production)

To build and run the Docker containers, run the following command in the project's root directory:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

To run without building (when already built) use the command without the --build-argument:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the containers from running, use the following command:

```
docker-compose down
```

If additionally the removal of created volumes is desired, add the argument -v:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

## Running Dev Environment

To start the redis database run

```
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

To populate it with our data run the `src/redis.ipynb` notebook.

The Streamlit app can be started by navigating into the `app/` directory and running

```
streamlit run app.py
```
